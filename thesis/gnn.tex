The Graph Neural Network model~\cite{scarselli2009graph} (GNN) is a quite recent (2009) connectionist model, based on recursive neural networks and capable of classifying almost all types of graphs. The main difference between the GNN model and previous connectionist models is the possibility of processing directly nonpositional and cyclic graphs, containing both node labels and edge labels. Although some similar solutions were introduced in an earlier model, the \emph{RNN-LE}~\cite{bianchini2005recursive} in 2005, it was the GNN model that combined several techniques with a novel learning schema to provide a direct and flexible method for graph processing.
